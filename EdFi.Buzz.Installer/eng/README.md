# Project Buzz Installer

These scripts were made possible thanks to the Ed-Fi Alliance and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.

## Description

The installation script downloads all the assets needed for the Ed-Fi Buzz. Artifacts are placed in the dist/ directory at the root of this project

It validates existence of NuGet Package Provider, Node JS, IIS, SQL Server and Postgres. Retrieves the latest release of several Ed-Fi Buzz NuGet packages. Downloads prequisites from the web.

The ETL requires a default, local instance of SQL Server, and the user executing the script must have sufficient permissions. Any existing Buzz databases on the build server should be backed-up and removed before running this build script.

## Installation
- **Database:** This application provides the scripts to create the database structures necessary to execute Ed-Fi Buzz.
- **ETL:** This application provides two ETL modules to load Google Form Survey data to the Buzz database, and to port data from the ODS data sources to Postgres.
- **API:** GraphQL-based API for supporting the Ed-Fi Buzz solution.
- **UI:** Project Buzz Web Application..
