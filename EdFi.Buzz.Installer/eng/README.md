# Project Buzz Installer

These scripts were made possible thanks to the Ed-Fi Alliance and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation.

## Description

The installation script downloads all the assets needed for the Ed-Fi Buzz. Artifacts are placed in the dist/ directory at the root of this project

It validates existence of NuGet Package Provider, Node JS, IIS, SQL Server and Postgres. Retrieves the latest release of several Ed-Fi Buzz NuGet packages. Downloads prerequisites from the web.

The ETL requires a default, local instance of SQL Server, and the user executing the script must have sufficient permissions. Any existing Buzz databases on the build server should be backed-up and removed before running this build script.

## Installation

- **Database:** This application provides the scripts to create the database structures necessary to execute Ed-Fi Buzz.
- **ETL:** This application provides two ETL modules to load Google Form Survey data to the Buzz database, and to port data from the ODS data sources to Postgres.
- **API:** GraphQL-based API for supporting the Ed-Fi Buzz solution.
- **UI:** Project Buzz Web Application..

## Prerequisites

We recommend that the following prerequisites are installed on the machine that you are going to run the scripts on.

- Node Js LTS version https://nodejs.org/en/
- Postgresql
- IIS with the [Application Request Routing](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing) and [URL Rewrite](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) modules, installed and configured per the documentation to provide request routing.
- [dotnet runtime 3.1.9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-3.1.9-windows-x64-installer) is used by the Windows Service Wrapper ([winsw](https://github.com/winsw/winsw/))
- The [IIS URL Rewrite Module version 2.1](https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite) provides routing for both IIS websites to support React as a single-page application (SPA) and for API's reverse proxy routes.
- [Application Request Routing version 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47333) is used by the API site for configuring reverse proxy routes in IIS.

## Setup Instructions

- Choose a drive and root directory location. For our purposes, `D:\Ed-Fi\Buzz` will be used in examples.
- Create an empty directory`D:\Ed-Fi\UI\build`. We will map an IIS website to this directory as the Buzz UI.
- Create an empty directory `D:\Ed-Fi\API-Redirect` for the reverse proxy rules. We will point the IIS API site to this directory, and later install redirection rules in a web.config. This will be the Buz API endpoint.
- Download the NuGet package edfi.buzz from the [Ed-Fi Azure Artifact Repository](https://dev.azure.com/ed-fi-alliance/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/_packaging?_a=feed&feed=EdFi%40Local)r
- Rename the file's extension from `.nupkg` to `.zip`.
- Expand the edfi.buzz zip package to a temporary location - `C:\temp\edfi`, for example.
- Create a `Buzz` website in IIS using `D:\Ed-Fi\Buzz\UI`. See the `IIS Web site` section below.
- Configure SSL bindings, apply a certificate and port bindings. The Buzz UI web site would be installed to D:\Ed-Fi\Buzz\UI\build. Note the port (if other than https 443), and the location for the configuration (if different than the example) in step 2.
- Create another SSL bound website called `Buzz-Api` for the Buzz API. Point  the folder contents to the empty `D:\Ed-Fi\Buzz\API-Redirect` folder. (The install will create a single web.config file to redirect calls to the locally hosted API service endpoint)
- Repeat the SSL binding step to apply SSL certificates and ports for the `Buzz-API` website.
- In the Application Request Routing module settings, ensure that `Enable proxy` is checked.

![ARR configuration in IIS](./images/iis-arr-config.png)
- Open PowerShell console as an Administrator.
-Set your current location to the edfi-buzz's `eng\Windows` directory.
- Make a copy the `example.configuration.json` file and renamed it to `configuration.json`.
- See the `General configuration` section for editing the `configuration.json` file to include the values according to your installation environment.

## IIS Web site

Create a website for IIS per your internal procedures. For the configuration, note the install location and port. Configure the ARR and URL Rewrite modules for IIS from the link above. The installation will include a web.config to set up routes within the UI React application.

### Configuration file

The configuration variables for the installation are in the **'Windows\configuration.json'** file. In this file you can update the values to adapt them before the installation.

- Run as Administrator. It requires administrator privileges.
- Set the execution policy to Bypass for the duration of the PowerShell session.

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

- Execute the install.ps1 script. If the configuration.json file is in the same folder, then

```powershell
C:\temp\edfi-buzz.1.0.0.384\eng\Windows> .\install.ps1
```

- Configuration file. It receives the configPath Full path to a JSON document containing configuration settings for Buzz. Defaults to **.\configuration.json** in the same directory.

![configuration](./images/configurationJSON.png)

- The script will not run on PowerShell Core because WebAdministration does not load properly.

The installation script must be run in PowerShell as an administrator.

![installation](./images/install.png)

- After a successful install, you should see that all Service applications are in a Running state, and web sites return HTTP status 200.

```powershell

## Common Problems
##### 1. Installation fails with this error:
**Please verify all your online package sources are available (OR) package id, version are specified correctly:**

```powershell
Downloading the package for Buzz Database application ...
Install-EdFiPackage installing  edfi.buzz.database...
D:\temp\tools\nuget install edfi.buzz.database -source EdFi -version 0.1.0-pre0123 -outputDirectory D:\temp\packages -prerelease
Package 'edfi.buzz.database 0.1.0-pre0123' is not found in the following primary source(s): 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\.nuget\packages\,https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/ed-fi-alliance/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/_packaging/EdFi/nuget/v3/index.json'. Please verify all your online package sources are available (OR) package id, version are specified correctly.
Ed-Fi Buzz installation failed.
Finished Buzz install..
```
##### Solution
**1. Clear All Nuget Cache(s)**
To do this, follow the instructions in this link [Clearing local folders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/managing-the-global-packages-and-cache-folders#clearing-local-folders).

**2. Wait 10 minutes and try again.**
If the first option doesn't work. just try waiting 10 minutes. The packages take some time, after they have been deployed, to actually be available.
