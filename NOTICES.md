    Copyright (c) 2019, The Work Sans Project Authors
    (https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) with Reserved Font Name Work
    Sans. Work Sans is designed by Wei Huang and is published under the SIL Open
    Font License Version 1.1.

    This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
    This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:
    http://scripts.sil.org/OFL

    -----------------------------------------------------------
    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    PREAMBLE The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts
    of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework
    in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
    including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
    sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
    derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
    any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
    license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their
    derivatives.

    DEFINITIONS "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
    Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source
    files, build scripts and documentation.

    "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright
    statement(s).

    "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
    distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or
    substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the Original
    Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new
    environment.

    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other
    person who contributed to the Font Software.

    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any
    person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed,
    modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
    Software, subject to the following conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original
    or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains
    the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as
    stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate
    machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
    fields can be easily viewed by the user.

    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s)
    unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright
    Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented
    to the users.

    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software
    shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version,
    except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the
    Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.

    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be
    distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under
    any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
    does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.

    TERMINATION This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions
    are not met.

    DISCLAIMER THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF

    # Security holding package
    
    This package name is not currently in use, but was formerly occupied
    by another package. To avoid malicious use, npm is hanging on to the
    package name, but loosely, and we'll probably give it to you if you
    want it.
    
    You may adopt this package by contacting support@npmjs.com and
    requesting the name.
